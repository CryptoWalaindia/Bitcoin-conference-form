### Step 3: Get Your Form URL and Field IDs

1. **Get Form URL**:
   - Click the **"Send"** button in your form
   - Copy the form URL (it looks like: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc...`)

2. **Get Field IDs**:
   - Click the **"Preview"** button (eye icon) in your form
   - Right-click on the preview page and select **"View Page Source"**
   - Press `Ctrl+F` and search for `"entry."`
   - You'll find field IDs like `entry.123456789`, `entry.987654321`, etc.
   - Note down the field IDs in order:
     - Full Name field ID: `entry.XXXXXXXXX`
     - Email field ID: `entry.XXXXXXXXX`
     - Phone field ID: `entry.XXXXXXXXX`
     - Age field ID: `entry.XXXXXXXXX`
     - Timestamp field ID: `entry.XXXXXXXXX` (if added)
     - Source field ID: `entry.XXXXXXXXX` (if added)

### Step 4: Update the Code

Once you have your form URL and field IDs, you need to update the code:

1. Open `src/lib/webhook-fallback.ts`
2. Find line 52 and replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID
3. Replace the field IDs on lines 57-64:

```typescript
// Replace these with your actual field IDs:
formData.append('entry.YOUR_FULL_NAME_FIELD_ID', data.full_name)
formData.append('entry.YOUR_EMAIL_FIELD_ID', data.email)
formData.append('entry.YOUR_PHONE_FIELD_ID', data.phone || '')
formData.append('entry.YOUR_AGE_FIELD_ID', data.age.toString())

// Optional fields (if you added them):
formData.append('entry.YOUR_TIMESTAMP_FIELD_ID', new Date().toISOString())
formData.append('entry.YOUR_SOURCE_FIELD_ID', 'Bitcoin Conference Registration Form')
```

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. **Build and run your application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Test the fallback**:
   - Temporarily disable your internet or Supabase connection
   - Fill out and submit the registration form
   - Check your Google Form responses to see if the data was received

## üìä How It Works

Your registration form now follows this priority:

1. **Primary**: Supabase database (when available)
2. **Fallback 1**: Google Forms (your new primary fallback)
3. **Fallback 2**: Formspree (if configured)
4. **Fallback 3**: Webhook services (if configured)
5. **Fallback 4**: Email services (if configured)
6. **Final Fallback**: Local storage (always works)

## üîç Monitoring Submissions

### Google Forms Dashboard
- Go to your Google Form
- Click the **"Responses"** tab
- View all submissions in real-time
- Export to Google Sheets for analysis

### Browser Console
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for submission logs
- Look for messages like: "Google Forms submission completed"

## üìã Example Form Configuration

Here's what your Google Form should look like:

```
